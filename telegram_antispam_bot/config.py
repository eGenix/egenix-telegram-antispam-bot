""" eGenix Antispam Bot for Telegram Configuration

    The values in this module can be overridden using a module
    "local_config" or by providing OS environment variables of the same
    name with "TG_" prefix, e.g. export TG_SESSION_NAME="mybot".

### Telegram API

# API access. You can get these from
# https://core.telegram.org/api/obtaining_api_id#obtaining-api-id
#
# See https://docs.pyrogram.org/faq/why-is-the-api-key-needed-for-bots
# for why these are needed. In short: pyrogram doesn't use the TG Bot
# API, but instead talks directly to the TG API.
#
# If you don't want to keep the API credentials on the server, you can
# have the installation process run the bot once with the correct
# credentials and then set these to dummy values in the config. They are
# only needed during the auth process.

# look ambiguous, e.g. 0 and O, 1 and I. The default challenge
# implementation matches these case-insensitive.

### Customization

# Override default values with custom ones from a local module
try:
    from local_config import *
except ImportError:
    pass

# Replace values defined in the module with OS environment field values
# where available.
